# reveal
A simple picture revealer game as a part of our project for Software Development. Answer trivia questions correctly to reveal 
parts of a picture. The goal is to guess the picture quickly.

To run, navigate to the Github Pages link (https://vihanagarwal97.github.io/reveal/). Unfortunately, the app does not work on mobile.

Technologies and tools we are using:
Javascript, HTML, and CSS,  
PIXI js,  
Howler js,  
JQuery,  
Require js,  
Sweetalert  

If you want to edit the source code, we use an editor called Brackets. Other editors will not set up an environment that works with 
PIXI.js.

The music is called "Primavera," and was written by Ludovico Einaudi (Copyright 2006 Chester Music Limited).
